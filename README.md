# Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains a Python script (`script.py`) for analyzing wine quality data. The script uses machine learning techniques to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install the following using any package manager):
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/anirudh-pulavarthy/WineQualityAnalysis.git
     cd WineQualityAnalysis
     ```

2. Install dependencies:
    After placing required libraries in ```requirements.txt```
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Run the script:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

## File Structure

- `script.py`: Main script for wine quality analysis.
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Results

The script outputs:
- Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
- Visualizations of feature importance and data distributions
